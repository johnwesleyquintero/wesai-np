# Daily Progress Report: Incremental UX & Workflow Enhancements

## Summary
Today's focus was on executing a series of incremental improvements to enhance the core user experience and address minor technical debts. We've made our UI feedback more responsive and streamlined the AI chat workflow, directly supporting our "operator-first" philosophy.

## Key Achievements

### 1. UX Improvement: Actionable Toast Notifications
- **Problem:** UI notifications (toasts) for events like "Note Saved" were on a fixed timer, which could occasionally interrupt a user's flow or be missed.
- **Solution:** We've upgraded all toast notifications. They now include a manual dismiss button, giving users direct control over the UI. We also improved the iconography to be more semantically correct for success, error, and info states.
- **Impact:** The UI feels more responsive and professional. Operators can acknowledge and dismiss feedback at their own pace.

### 2. Workflow Enhancement: "Edit Last Message" in Chat
- **Problem:** Correcting a typo or modifying the last query sent to the AI assistant required retyping the entire message from scratch, adding unnecessary friction.
- **Solution:** We've implemented a classic chat power-user feature. When the chat input is empty, pressing the `ArrowUp` key now recalls the last message sent. The message is removed from the chat history and its content is loaded into the input box, ready for editing and resubmission.
- **Impact:** This significantly speeds up the chat workflow, especially for iterative tasks, making the AI assistant a more efficient partner.

### 3. Documentation Update
- **Action:** This progress report has been updated to document today's enhancements.
