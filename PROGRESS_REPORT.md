# Daily Progress Report: Stability & UX Enhancements

## Summary
Today's focus was on enhancing the stability and user experience of the application by addressing several critical "hidden bugs." These fixes significantly improve the reliability of the AI assistant's tool usage, make the core editing experience more intuitive, and resolve a key UI dead-end. We also updated project documentation to reflect these improvements.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Enhanced AI Reliability: Resolved Tool Race Condition
- **Problem:** In the "General Assistant" mode, if the AI called the same tool multiple times in a single turn (e.g., `createNote` twice), the UI could display the result of the first call in the UI element intended for the second call, creating data confusion.
- **Solution:** We implemented a robust solution by assigning a unique, client-side identifier to each pending tool-call message. The system now uses these unique IDs to precisely match function results to their corresponding UI elements, ensuring a perfect 1-to-1 update.
- **Impact:** The AI's actions are now always accurately reflected in the user interface, which is critical for building user trust and ensuring the assistant is a reliable operational partner.

### 2. Improved User Experience: Expanded Undo/Redo Scope
- **Problem:** The undo/redo keyboard shortcut (`Cmd/Ctrl+Z`) was unintentionally restrictive. It only functioned when the user's cursor was focused on the main content area, failing to work for changes made to a note's title or tags.
- **Solution:** We removed the restrictive focus check from the global keyboard listener. The undo/redo action now correctly applies to the entire active note's state (title, content, and tags), regardless of which specific element within the editor has focus.
- **Impact:** This creates a more intuitive and predictable editing experience. Users can now confidently revert any change to the active note, preventing frustration and potential data loss.

### 3. Fixed Critical UI Bug: The "Trapped User" State
- **Problem:** On desktop, if a user collapsed the sidebar while on the `WelcomeScreen` (no active note), there was no visible control to expand it again, effectively trapping them without navigation.
- **Solution:** The `WelcomeScreen` now receives the sidebar's collapsed state and renders a header with a toggle button that appears on desktop *only when the sidebar is collapsed*.
- **Impact:** This fix ensures that navigation controls are always accessible, preventing a frustrating user dead-end and improving the overall polish of the application's UI.

### 4. Project Documentation Updated
- **Action:** The project's `README.md` file was updated to highlight the newly robust undo/redo system.
- **Action:** The application's version number was incremented to `1.1.1` to officially mark the inclusion of these stability fixes.
- **Impact:** Keeps documentation current and accurately reflects the progress and maturity of the project.
