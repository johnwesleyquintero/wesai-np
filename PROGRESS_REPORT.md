# Daily Progress Report: Incremental UX & Workflow Enhancements

## Summary
Today's focus was on executing a series of incremental improvements to enhance the core user experience and address minor technical debts. We've made our UI feedback more responsive and streamlined the AI chat workflow, directly supporting our "operator-first" philosophy.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Workflow Enhancement: Manual Save Control
- **Problem:** The editor's automatic save-on-pause behavior, while safe, could be visually distracting for users who prefer explicit control over when their work is saved.
- **Solution:** We have transitioned the editor from a debounced auto-save system to manual-save. A "Save" button now appears in the editor header whenever there are unsaved changes. The existing safety net that saves work when navigating away from a note remains in place.
- **Impact:** This provides users with more direct control over the save process, eliminating the "Saving..." indicator that would appear during pauses in writing and clarifying the note's state.

### 2. UX Improvement: Actionable Toast Notifications
- **Problem:** UI notifications (toasts) for events like "Note Saved" were on a fixed timer, which could occasionally interrupt a user's flow or be missed.
- **Solution:** We've upgraded all toast notifications. They now include a manual dismiss button, giving users direct control over the UI. We also improved the iconography to be more semantically correct for success, error, and info states.
- **Impact:** The UI feels more responsive and professional. Operators can acknowledge and dismiss feedback at their own pace.

### 3. Workflow Enhancement: "Edit Last Message" in Chat
- **Problem:** Correcting a typo or modifying the last query sent to the AI assistant required retyping the entire message from scratch, adding unnecessary friction.
- **Solution:** We've implemented a classic chat power-user feature. When the chat input is empty, pressing the `ArrowUp` key now recalls the last message sent. The message is removed from the chat history and its content is loaded into the input box, ready for editing and resubmission.
- **Impact:** This significantly speeds up the chat workflow, especially for iterative tasks, making the AI assistant a more efficient partner.

### 4. Documentation Update
